These are the resources I used to study for the CISSP. 
> [Note] 
> Please note that this is not an exhaustive list so please look for additional information to supplement your studies. 

Inside Cloud and Security's Exam Cram:
	Make sure to watch is addendum video for the 2024 update of the exam.

11th Hour CISSP:
	I listened to this on the car during my commute. 

Sunflower CISSP: 
	This material was effective for a final review but I found it to contain redundant information.

### Practice Tests

Pocket Prep CISSP:
	This was my main resource I used to review and remember the concepts 
Boson CISSP:
	This practice deck was too technical for the exam in my opinion. While it does help with concepts with Kerberos, it can easily get you off the track of 'Thinking like a Manager'.
