This is my personal site on projects I am learning about.

## Projects
You can also see various projects I've done in the 'Projects' section in the left column and learn more on how to implement individual Cloud services and technologies under their respective OtterByte sections.
Here are some of my projects I've been working with:
### AWS:
- [[02.03 Transforming images using S3 Events and Lambda]]
### Azure:
- [[02.01 Azure Sentinel Threat Detection and Map]]
- [[02.03.01 AzureGoat Overview]]
## Education and Certifications
While hands on skills serve as a better litmus test for our skills, formal credentials and certifications provide a proof of achievement stating that we know the foundational knowledge in the technology. Dive into my tech certification write ups in the [[Certification Index]].
