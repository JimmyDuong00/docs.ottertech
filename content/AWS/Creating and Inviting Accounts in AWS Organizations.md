In the target account, remember to accept the invitation inside the AWS Organizations portal and you are now connected to the organization. To enable role switching, follow below to enable IAM access to the account.
#### Adding IAM role to target account
Now that we have sent an invitation, we need to add the proper IAM roles in order to allow access from the management account:

You can give it any role name but 'OrganizationAccountAccessRole'  is the standard role name that AWS has when allowing organization access: ![[Pasted image 20240702081048.png]]
