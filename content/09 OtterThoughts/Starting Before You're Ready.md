When going through my YouTube feed, I saw Matt Huang's video: https://youtu.be/KVyM6LN8DaQ?si=QWMtdIdf9ueq-aoZ

I am always struggling with perfectionism. Continuously revisioning a project until it becomes perfect before I can show the world the final product. This results in lots of effort lost due to constant revisioning with no concrete completion or milestones reached. 

#### Case Study: OtterTech
An example of this would be this very website, I have used many methods of hosting this website until I settled on using Jacky Zhao's quartz. Before this website, I have tried various static site generators:

Astro Starlight, Cactus, and Cody Theme
Hugo and various other themes

While I did learn how to host the various frameworks using Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Actions, I failed to settle on one and stick with it. I did not have a simple way to create and link concepts together as well as write projects for the things I have learned during my time at WGU studying for the [[Bachelor of Science Cloud Computing]] and [[Master of Science Cybersecurity and Information Assurance]] degrees as well as various other #certification . 

#### Continuous Improvement
Just like how we are always seeking to improve code through versioning, I believe it is beneficial for me to *start before I'm ready* beginning from now on.
