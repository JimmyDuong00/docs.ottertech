**It is a memory test**

Don't stress it. Keep resources minimal.
Note:
I would like to emphasize that this is mostly a memory test. Don't stress it, keep your resources minimal to streamline the learning process.

---
**Videos**

- Watch the videos but do not take notes

- Actively watch - No distractions

---
**Practice Tests - First Round** 

- Take the practice tests the first time - Note your scores
- Reread all questions and see what you got wrong

---
**Practice Tests - Review Rounds**
- Go back and learn material that you do not understand
 - Retake tests until your score is ~90%
 Notes:
 Use Google and ChatGPT to reinforce knowledge

**Practice Tests**

Jason Dion - Udemy

Notes:
For practice tests, I recommend Jason Dion's practice tests on Udemy. Make sure to purchase them when they are on sale since Udemy always has sales which are more affordable than the full price.

- Flag any questions you are second guessing
- Read questions **thoroughly** before answering
