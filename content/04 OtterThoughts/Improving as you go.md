As we are already in the second week of September '24, I'm reorganizing and doing some housekeeping for the  website and found myself faced with the chicken or the egg scenario. "Should I organize the folders first and then do the projects or vice versa?". 

I then remembered about Dave Malaway's video titled, "How labels multiply your knowledgebase, cash, time, on LOW effort." https://youtu.be/B1QqAZeEfes?si=9w1GVbV3o6nHigh8

Quote: "If you try to make it perfect 1st try you're gonna procrastinate forever".

I figured I could use [[Kaizen]] to continuously work on the site as I continue to work on my projects. This also applies to my YouTube channel where my fear of not attaining perfection is stopping my from making progress.
