11/8 It's already past the first week of the month. The weather is getting colder and daylight is burning out faster. It's time to put in the work and create my own success in this 'winter arc'.

## IAM Concentration
I want to focus my efforts into IAM for the remainder of the year.
### SailPoint IdentityIQ
I will be creating a virtual machine that runs SailPoint IdentityIQ. The plan is to have connectors like Active Directory to simulate a real world environment.

### Okta
I am currently working through Andrew Chanthaphone's "IAM Fundamentals with Okta" LinkedIn Learning course.

With the hands on portion, I will create a couple hands on projects:

(Add links here!)

## Azure
Continue working on [[Entra ID]] as well as other infrastructure services.

## JLPT N4
I only have three weeks out to study and I need to touch up on reading speed and comprehension.

So far, I was able to understand most, if not all N4 level conversations but I am severely lacking in the kanji aspect. 

Going back to [The Moe Way](https://learnjapanese.moe/resources/) for resources and found that they recommended the new [Kaishi](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551) Deck which I found is very easy to go through. My plan is to get through this 1.5k deck by mid next week and start drilling down on my weak points. 

この試験わ私のとても大切な瞬間です。十年勉強を練らんでいますので。
