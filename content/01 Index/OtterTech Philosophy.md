I'm still in the process of developing my personal philosophy and as my life progresses, I'm sure I will find and change my perspective along the way. 

As I continue down the journey of life and working on OtterTech, I want this website to be continuously flowing and changing just like the waves of the ocean. Since technology evolves and my perspective changes I will be moving things around, shifting and organizing categories to better fit the concepts I am trying to convey to you. I hope you notice the tide shifting.
