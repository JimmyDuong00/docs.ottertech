Welcome to my little alcove in the vast depths of the web! Learn more [[About Me]].
## Abyssal Kelp Collective
Check out my various projects in the [[Abyssal Kelp Collective]].

The goal of this website is to showcase various Cloud and Cybersecurity projects I have built alongside my studies. I also try to provide step-by-step guides for fellow peers that want to build projects but need a helping hand in finding inspiration to create and potentially put a spin on to these labs. 
## Shells of Mastery

Dive into my education and tech certification write ups in the [[Shells of Mastery Index]].

While hands on projects serve as a better litmus test for our skills, formal credentials provide a proof of achievement, stating that we went through the gauntlet and know foundational knowledge in a certain technology. They are like little shells we can collect and stash. 

My goal is to share tidbits of information I used to pass these certifications in order to help others in advancing their knowledge and skillset.
## Tidal Updates
[[OtterLog Index]]

With the overuse of social media such as LinkedIn and Medium, I wanted to have a little spot on the web to share my monthly goals and updates on the projects I am creating. 

This website is only read by those who are interested in my work and is a more secluded spot on the cyberspace, so thank you for reading this!

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages using Quartz with markdown text edited with Obsidian.md.
Special thanks to Jacky Zhao for creating Quartz!
