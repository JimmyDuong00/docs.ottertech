After thinking about [[Starting Before You're Ready]], I figured what best to follow my philosophy by scheduling for the JLPT N4 this December (Shout out to my friend, Dendrobyte for the push!). 

Now that I have registered for the N4, I will utilize the immersion method to learn more deeply into the language. I have been learning Japanese since 2010 and had a history with Duolingo but never took it seriously.
