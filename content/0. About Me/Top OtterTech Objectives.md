## Projects and Guides
The goal of this website is to showcase various Cloud and Cybersecurity projects I have built alongside my studies. I also try to provide step-by-step guides for fellow students that want to build projects but need a helping hand in finding inspiration to create and possibly add on to these labs. 

## Certification Writeups
I have taken a good amount of IT certifications ranging from basic hardware support to architecting solutions in the Cloud. My goal is to share tidbits of information I used to pass these certifications in order to help others in advancing their knowledge and skillset. 

## Updates
With the overuse of social media such as LinkedIn and Medium, I wanted to have a little spot on the web to share my monthly goals and updates on the projects I am creating. 

This website is only read by those who are interested in my work and is a more secluded spot on the cyberspace, so thank you for reading this!
