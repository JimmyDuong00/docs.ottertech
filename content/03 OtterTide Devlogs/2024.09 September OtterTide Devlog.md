Another month! We're almost wrapping up the year!

For this month, I would like to continue on building out my enterprise infrastructure to build and showcase my skills 

## OtterTech Network Project
As I pick up OtterTech to speed, I wanted to work on the local network to sort out a couple of issues I'm dealing with. 
### Syncthing File Sync
Setup Syncthing to sync all files between devices (Windows, Linux, and Android)
### Grafana and Prometheus Monitoring
Connect cloud metrics to local on-prem server using Prometheus and provide uptime and metrics for the network.
### Snort IDS 
Setup Intrusion Detection and alerts
### Setting up OpenVPN
Install OpenVPN on endpoint to allow network connectivity for remote network access.
## OtterTech YouTube Channel
- Create channel  [[Starting Before You're Ready]]
- Work on Obsidian and Quartz Website tutorial [[Host your Obsidian notes online for free!]]

Now that I have created the OtterTech YouTube channel, I will begin to start scripting out the videos. Taking inspiration from NoBoilerPlate's channel which I found aligns with my goal of making simplistic but encompassing material. 

## Road to JLPT
Now that I have registered for the N4 JLPT in December, I will utilize the immersion method to learn more deeply into the language. I have been learning Japanese since 2010 and had a history with Duolingo but never took it seriously.
