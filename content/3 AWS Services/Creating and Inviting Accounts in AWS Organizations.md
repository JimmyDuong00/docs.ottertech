Create or invite other AWS accounts into the organization structure.

### Invite Account
To invite an existing account to the org, you need the target account ID or email address to create and invite.
#### Send Invite
In the AWS Organizations portal:

In the target account, remember to accept the invitation inside the AWS Organizations portal and you are now connected to the organization. To enable role switching, follow below to enable IAM access to the account.
#### Adding IAM role to target account
Now that we have sent an invitation, we need to add the proper IAM roles in order to allow access from the management account:

You can give it any role name but 'OrganizationAccountAccessRole'  is the standard role name that AWS has when allowing organization access: ![[content/3 AWS Services/Images/Pasted image 20240702081048.png]]

### Role Switching
For invited accounts: In order to implement this, in the destination account, add an IAM role to allow administrator access for another AWS account.

On the top right side, select the 'Switch Role' button:

Select switch role when done:
