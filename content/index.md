## Projects and Guides
[[OtterTech Project Index]]
The goal of this website is to showcase various Cloud and Cybersecurity projects I have built alongside my studies. I also try to provide step-by-step guides for fellow students that want to build projects but need a helping hand in finding inspiration to create and possibly add on to these labs. 

## Education and Certifications
Dive into my tech certification write ups in the [[Education and Certification Index]].

While hands on skills serve as a better litmus test for our skills, formal credentials and certifications provide a proof of achievement stating that we know the foundational knowledge in the technology. My goal is to share tidbits of information I used to pass these certifications in order to help others in advancing their knowledge and skillset. 
## Updates
[[OtterTide Devlog Index]]

With the overuse of social media such as LinkedIn and Medium, I wanted to have a little spot on the web to share my monthly goals and updates on the projects I am creating. 

This website is only read by those who are interested in my work and is a more secluded spot on the cyberspace, so thank you for reading this!

This site is hosted on GitHub Pages using Quartz with markdown text edited with Obsidian.md.

Special thanks to Jacky Zhao for creating Quartz!
