Privileged Identity Management or PIM, is a way to allow for organizations to grant users privileged access for a set period of time to access resources. Once the set period passes, they will lose access to the resource.

This will ensure that critical resources are locked down and prevent unauthorized access.

To setup Privileged Identity Management, navigate to the PIM portal and select 'Microsoft Entra roles':
