I began studying for the AWS Security Specialty Certification this week.

I mainly focused on a deep dive into securing AWS services as well as working on hosting this website onto GitHub Actions.

Hosting this website on GitHub Actions
Utilized Quartz template created by Jacky Zhao to create this website. 
I used Obsidian to edit the Markdown files and added a DNS record by validating the TXT files to point to the docs.ottertech.cloud.
