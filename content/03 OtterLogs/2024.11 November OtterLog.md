11/8 It's already past the first week of the month. The weather is getting colder and daylight is burning out faster. It's time to put in the work for the "winter arc".

## IAM Concentration
I want to focus my efforts into IAM for the remainder of the year. In order to learn and specialize in a particular platform, I chose two for the time being:
### SailPoint IdentityIQ
I will be creating a virtual machine that runs SailPoint IdentityIQ. 

IdentityIQ or IIQ is an identity governance and administration (IGA) solution that helps companies manage user identities, access rights, and compliance requirements. It is designed to provide identity management capabilities, including access certification, policy enforcement, provisioning, while enabling users to have the appropriate level of access to applications and data.
### Okta
Okta Identity Workforce is used for a single sign on solution for organizations. It provides a single pane of glass for users.
