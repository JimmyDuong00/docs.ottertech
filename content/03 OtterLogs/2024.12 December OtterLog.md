This month was a pretty challenging one. I took the JLPT N4, met a good friend and caught a cold while basking in the cold.

I didn't work on studying much for any tech certs but went deep into Japanese to gear up for the test. I found Kaishi deck to prep me for it and I feel like it went suprisingly well.
