## Enjoying Life

> To have faith is to trust yourself to the water. When you swim you don't grab hold of the water, because if you do you will sink and drown. Instead you relax, and float. ðŸ¦¦
>
> _(Alan Watts)_

In order to enjoy life, a person needs to relax and have time for gratitude. 

Gratitude in all things, good and bad.

While it is easy to have gratitude for good things, the real self improvement is when you appreciate the bad. All the wrong choices and paths that you took, or life throws a curveball in your way, you still find the good out of the bad.

It doesn't mean you need to enjoy the bad situation but understanding how the situation developed and how you can grow and improve your circumstances will allow you to break past your self imposed limits.
