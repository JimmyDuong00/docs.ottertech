Hi I'm Jimmy and I am a Cloud Security Engineer that is always striving for excellence.   

I love creating infrastructure solutions according to best practices and making the cyberspace a more safe and secure experience.  
  
From architecting and configuring secure environments to incident response and recovery. I have played a dominant role in securing enterprise environments and protecting organizations involved with renewable energy and education.

I love to spend my time learning configuring cloud infrastructure and helping others do the same.

See you in the Cloud! ðŸ¦¦
